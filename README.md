## **Challenges and Solutions**

### **Challenge 1: Persistent Storage**
- **Problem**: Synchronizing real-time data between the frontend and backend.  
- **Solution**: Implemented MongoDB with Mongoose for robust schema validation and real-time data retrieval using API endpoints.

### **Challenge 2: Calendar View Integration**
- **Problem**: Customizing FullCalendar.js to render tasks dynamically.  
- **Solution**: Leveraged FullCalendar's event APIs and integrated RESTful endpoints for fetching and updating tasks.

### **Challenge 3: Filtering and Sorting**
- **Problem**: Complex filtering logic with multiple criteria.  
- **Solution**: Used MongoDB's aggregation pipeline to handle advanced queries and optimize performance.
